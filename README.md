This is what I like to call **Me Software** as in this is written by me and for me. I never planned on others using this project.
I started this project after I kept copying and pasting the same code over and over in my game projects. While this is quit a bit different then the copied code it is much cleaner and easier to use.

### Dependencies

- [vm](https://github.com/griush/zm) - Math library
- [zig-ecs](https://github.com/prime31/zig-ecs) - ECS library
