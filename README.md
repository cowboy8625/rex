## Who is this for

Well, mostly me. If your a curious person and want to poke around the code, this is for you.

## What is this

This is what I like to call **Me Software** as in this is written by me and for me. I never planned on others using this project.
I started this project after I kept copying and pasting the same code over and over in my game projects. While this is quit a bit different then the copied code it is much cleaner and easier to use.
